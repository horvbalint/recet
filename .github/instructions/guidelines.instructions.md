Always stick to the project's coding style and conventions. Dont make comments to separate code sections, only use them when absolutely necessary.

Don't forget that the project uses nebula (a nuxt layer) that contains many components and helper utilities for logic and styling. Make sure to leverage these utilities. You can find more information about nebula in the node_modules/nebula folder.

If you feel like that the instructions are not clear enough or if you feel like they are not possible to follow, ask for clarification and don't make assumptions. Same applies to derailing from the instructions.
